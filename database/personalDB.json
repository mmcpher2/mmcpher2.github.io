While working there, I realized that my interest in software moved beyond just selling the appications, and I determined it was time to make a pivot and learn the development side of software.  Part of my interest in development was also stirred up by my more artistic, creative side.  I have always wanted to do something that will allow me to utilize both my creative side, needing to create things, and my business/sales experience."

My first team was called the Jagged Ferrets, which is why we called our business Hobbs & Jills (The male and female ferret).  During this group project we styled first with a static header and footer, and then each person spent time working on their individual content within each page. No GIT problems, and a relatively smooth two days.  We had just wrapped up our first demo on Friday at noon when Steve threw us back into random groups to be finished by Wednesday morning.  This team was galled the Jackals's, also a great group.  Although our team meshed well, we were tasked by Steve to work on the data first, then structure, then styling... this caused some issues due the fact none of us really unserstand what a database should really look like, while styling is pretty understandable.  On top of this, with 4 hours to go on Tuesday, Steve told us to add a pagination bar at the bottom of our product page. AS WELL AS add 15 additional products.  We finished it with many bumps and bruises thanks to GIT and GitHub challended (Merge conflicts galore), but I think that I learned a lot, but don't necessarily feel like it after looking at the work of some other groups.  ALL GOOD, DON'T PANIC!"

One thing that I have found difficult to ignore is when questions are asked during classroom live coding... I have no questions to ask, yet, it seems, that many others in the class have PLENTY to say and question.  I still firmly believe that not everyone is built that way, myself in particular, and that I would rather come up with questions and answers as I work on projects and excersized myself.
