                    <strong>My Story:</strong> Over the past 4 years, I have been working in software sales for a company located in Nashille, TN called HealthStream.  While working there, I realized that my interest in software moved beyond just selling the appications, and I determined it was time to make a pivot and learn the development side of software.  Part of my interest in development was also stirred up by my more artistic, creative side.  I have always wanted to do something that will allow me to utilize both my creative side, needing to create things, and my business/sales experience.
